To run the code, please execute the following commands:

javac AccountService.java Account.java BankApp.java  # Compiles the Java files and generates AccountService.class, Account.class, and BankApp.class
java BankApp  # Runs the test

# I would like to clarify that, as I mentioned in a previous email, I have no prior experience with Java. I have spent the last three days trying to understand the assignment and how each class or public interface works.
